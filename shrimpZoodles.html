        <h2><strong>Have you had Garlic Shrimp Zoodles?</strong></h2>
        <p>
            Want a fast low-carb meal that's healthy and tasty? Try these 15 minute garlic shrimp zoodles. You've been waiting for the day that zoodles make it to this blog, right? Ok, you probably haven't. I'm making use of my Christmas spiralizer, and here they are in all their glory. Garlic + shrimp + zucchini noodles = low-carb heaven.I actually find the term "zoodles" a bit weird since I grew up with those zoo animal shaped pasta pieces in a tomato sauce in a can, and they were called Zoodles. I personally preferred Alphagetti because I could spell out rude words, but I was a bad child.
