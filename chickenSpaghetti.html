    <h2><strong>What is soul food Southern chicken spaghetti?</strong></h2>
    <p>
        Unlike traditional spaghetti, Southern chicken spaghetti does not include ground beef or meatballs. Not even marinara sauce!

        Succulent shredded chicken and spaghetti noodles are coated in a delicious mixture of cream cheese, sour cream, diced tomatoes, and cheddar cheese. It's then seasoned with onion, garlic, salt, and black pepper, to make a meal bursting with yummy flavors that you'll love!
